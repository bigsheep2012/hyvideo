1
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:11,581
Cells are the smallest living units of an organism.

2
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:17,091
All cells have three things in common, no matter what type of cell they are.

3
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:24,076
All cells have a cell membrane, which separates the inside of the cell from its environment,

4
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:32,030
cytoplasm, which is a jelly-like fluid, and DNA, which is the cell's genetic material.

5
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:37,076
There are two broad categories of cells.

6
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:42,080
The first category is eukaryotic cells.

7
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:47,034
They have organelles, which include the nucleus and other special parts.

8
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:55,030
Eukaryotic cells are more advanced, complex cells, such as those found in plants and animals.

9
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:00,021
The second category is prokaryotic cells.

10
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:04,078
They don't have a nucleus or membrane-enclosed organelles.

11
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:09,024
They do have genetic material, but it's not contained within a nucleus.

12
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:16,040
Prokaryotic cells are always one-celled, or unicellular, organisms, such as bacteria.

13
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:21,035
So, what are organelles?

14
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:24,088
Organelle means "little organ."

15
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:31,023
Organelles are the specialized parts of a cell that have unique jobs to perform.

16
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,180
Let's start with the nucleus, the control center of the cell.

17
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:41,155
The nucleus contains DNA, or genetic material.

18
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:47,035
DNA dictates what the cell is going to do, and how it's going to do it.

19
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:53,116
Chromatin is the tangled, spread out form of DNA found inside the nuclear membrane.

20
00:01:56,054 --> 00:02:02,068
When a cell is ready to divide, DNA condenses into structures known as chromosomes.

21
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:12,063
The nucleus also contains a nucleolus, which is a structure where ribosomes are made.

22
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:23,082
After ribosomes leave the nucleus, they will have the important job of synthesizing, or making, proteins.

23
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:32,151
Outside the nucleus, the ribosomes and the rest of the organelles float around in cytoplasm,

24
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:35,015
which is the jelly-like substance.

25
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:40,124
Ribosomes may wander freely within the cytoplasm,

26
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:47,086
or attach to the endoplasmic reticulum, sometimes abbreviated as "ER".

27
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:50,041
There are two types of ER:

28
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:53,051
rough ER has ribosomes attached to it,

29
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:57,106
and smooth ER doesn't have ribosomes attached to it.

30
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:06,004
The endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane-enclosed passageway for transporting materials,

31
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:09,054
such as the proteins synthesized by ribosomes.

32
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:18,004
Proteins and other materials emerge from endoplasmic reticulum in small vesicles

33
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:24,024
where the Golgi apparatus, sometimes called the Golgi body, receives them.

34
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,055
As proteins move through the Golgi body, they are customized into forms that the cell can use.

35
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:39,122
The Golgi body does this by folding the proteins into usable shapes

36
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:46,104
or adding other materials onto them, such as lipids or carbohydrates.

37
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:53,114
Vacuoles are sac-like structures that store different materials.

38
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:58,120
Here in this plant cell, the central vacuole stores water.

39
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:08,024
Going back to the animal cell, you will see an organelle called a lysosome.

40
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:13,126
Lysosomes are the garbage collectors that take in damaged or worn out cell parts.

41
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:19,043
They are filled with enzymes that break down this cellular debris.

42
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:25,105
The mitochondrion is an organelle that is the powerhouse for both animal and plant cells.

43
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:31,027
During a process called cellular respiration,

44
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:37,068
the mitochondria make ATP molecules that provide the energy for all of the cell's activities.

45
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:43,048
Cells that need more energy have more mitochondria.

46
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:50,061
Meanwhile, the cell maintains its shape through a cytoskeleton.

47
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:56,033
The cytoskeleton includes the threadlike microfilaments,

48
00:04:58,056 --> 00:05:01,154
which are made of protein, and microtubules, which are thin, hollow tubes.

49
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:09,078
Some organisms, such as plants, that are photoautotrophic

50
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:12,122
meaning they capture sunlight for energy

51
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:18,134
have cells with an organelle called a chloroplast.

52
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:23,027
The chloroplast is where photosynthesis happens.

53
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:27,080
It's green because it has a green pigment, called chlorophyll.

54
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:37,040
Plant cells also have a cell wall outside of their cell membranes that shape, support and protect the plant cell.

55
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:41,051
Animal cells never have a cell wall.

56
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:48,184
There are many other unique structures that only some cells have. Here are just a few.

57
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:55,090
In humans, for example, the respiratory tract is lined with cells that have cilia.

58
00:05:56,062 --> 00:06:00,128
These are microscopic hair-like projections that can move in waves.

59
00:06:02,014 --> 00:06:07,080
This feature helps trap inhaled particles in the air, and expels them when you cough.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,064
Another unique feature in some cells is flagella.

61
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,096
Some bacteria have flagella.

62
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:23,383
A flagellum is like a little tail that can help a cell move, or propel, itself.

63
00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:28,114
The only human cell that has a flagellum is a sperm cell.

64
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:32,621
In summary, remember:

65
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:40,036
eukaryotic cells are plant and animal cells with a nucleus and membrane-enclosed organelles,

66
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:47,070
while prokaryotic cells are unicellular organisms without these things.

67
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:54,080
All cells have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and genetic material.

68
00:06:56,799 --> 00:07:02,871
And, even though only plant cells have chloroplasts, both plant and animal cells have mitochondria.
