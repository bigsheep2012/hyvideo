1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:04,330
in order for plants to grow they need
imports of carbon dioxide

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:06,036
water and energy

3
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:10,120
the chemical process by which plants use
these resources to manufacture glucose

4
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:14,099
the building blocks of plants is called
photosynthesis

5
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:18,026
in the process oxygen gases produced

6
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:19,091
as a byproduct

7
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:22,700
the energy for photosynthesis originates
in the Sun

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,360
and arrives at the earth as sunlight

9
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:30,038
this light has both a wave and a
particle nature

10
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:34,039
the particles or photons are the
smallest units of light

11
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,638
photons oscillates along a path which is
measured

12
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,500
as wavelengths

13
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:45,016
the light emitted from the Sun contains
photons in a wide spectrum of

14
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,063
wavelengths

15
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:49,130
called the electromagnetic spectrum

16
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:53,081
photosynthetic organisms use only a
small portion of the electromagnetic

17
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:55,043
spectrum

18
00:00:55,043 --> 00:00:58,051
called visible light

19
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:02,100
photosynthetic organisms contain
pigments that facilitate the capture of

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,028
wavelengths of light

21
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,120
in the visible light range

22
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:11,028
the color of a pigment comes from the
wavelengths of light reflected

23
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:16,049
plants appear green because they reflect
yellow and green wavelengths of light

24
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,138
red and blue wavelengths of light are
absorbed by these pigments

25
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:24,567
and provide the energy that is used for
photosynthesis

26
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,987
within eukaryotic photosynthetic
organisms also known as 

27
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:29,761
photoautotropes

28
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:34,466
the chemical reactions of photosynthesis
occur within plant cells

29
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,068
in specialized structures known as
chloroplast

30
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:42,700
photosynthesis consists of two sets of
reactions

31
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:46,021
the light dependent reactions and the
Calvin cycle

32
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:49,132
within the chloroplast are small disc
like structures

33
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:54,060
called thylakoids which are
surrounded by a fluid-filled space

34
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:55,079
called the stroma

35
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,115
the reactions that synthesize glucose
the Calvin cycle

36
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:02,039
occur in the stroma

37
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,040
the light dependent reactions occur in
the thylakoid

38
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:09,012
it is here that conversion of light
energy to chemical energy

39
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,621
is initiated

40
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,848
in most photosynthetic organisms thylakoid
contain pairs a photosystems

41
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:20,114
called photosystem one and photosystem
two

42
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:23,700
that work in tandem to produce the
energy that will later be used in the

43
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:24,588
stroma

44
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:28,810
to manufacture sugars

45
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,098
the photosystems of the thylakoid
consist of a network

46
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:34,100
of accessory pigment molecules and
chlorophyll

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,093
the molecules that absorb the photons of
light

48
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:41,462
within the pigment molecules the absorbed
light energy

49
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,920
excites electrons to a higher state
photosystems will channel the

50
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:47,131
excitation energy

51
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:52,115
gathered by the pigment molecules to a
reaction center chlorophyll molecule

52
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:56,634
which will then pass the electrons to a
series of proteins

53
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:59,940
located on the final thylakoid membrane

54
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:04,111
photons of light strike photosystems
1&2 simultaneously

55
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:08,560
we will examine what happens with the
photon striking photosystem

56
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,220
two first

57
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:15,119
the energized electrons are passed from
the reaction center of photosystem two

58
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,026
to an electron transport chain

59
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:22,065
the electrons lost by photosystem two

60
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:25,304
are replaced by a process called
photolysis

61
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:28,374
which involves the oxidation a water
molecule

62
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,360
producing free electrons and oxygen gas

63
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:35,102
well this oxygen gas is a byproduct of
photosynthesis

64
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:43,002
it is an important input to the
cellular respiration pathways

65
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:46,104
as electrons passed through the electron
transport chain

66
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:51,102
the energy from the electron is used to
pump hydrogen ions from the stroma

67
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:56,077
to the thylakoid creating a
concentration gradient

68
00:03:56,077 --> 00:04:00,115
this gradient powers a protein called
ATP synthases

69
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:04,042
which phosphorylate ADP to form

70
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,108
ATP

71
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:09,024
the low-energy electrons leaving
photosystem two

72
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,089
are shuttled to photosystem one

73
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:16,140
within photosystem one low energy electrons
are reenergized

74
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:20,078
and are passed through an electron
transport chain where they are used to

75
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:22,092
reduce the electron carrier

76
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:29,092
NADP+ to NADPH

77
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:42,087
when the chloroplast is receiving a
steady supply of photons

78
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:45,128
NADPH and ATP molecules

79
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:49,054
are rapidly being provided to the
metabolic pathways

80
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:50,125
in the stroma

81
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:56,083
therefore the ATP and NADPH form during
the light dependent reactions

82
00:04:56,083 --> 00:05:00,161
are used in the stroma to fuel the
Calvin cycle reactions

83
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:04,270
the Calvin cycle consists of a series of
reactions

84
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:07,824
that reduce carbon dioxide to produce
the carbohydrate

85
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,270
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

86
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:14,065
the cycle consists of three steps the
first of which

87
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:16,149
is carbon fixation

88
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:22,053
in this step carbon dioxide is attached
to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate

89
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:25,942
resulting in a six carbon molecule that
splits into two

90
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:31,630
three carbon molecules

91
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:34,144
the second step is a sequence of
reactions using electrons from

92
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:38,052
NADPH and some of the ATP

93
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:45,052
to reduce carbon dioxide

94
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:47,093
in the final step ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate

95
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:50,164
is regenerated

96
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:56,141
for every three turns have the cycle 5
molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

97
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:04,041
are used to reform three molecules of
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate

98
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:06,159
the remaining

99
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:10,136
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is then used
to make glucose

100
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:16,090
fatty acids or glycerol

101
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,084
it takes two molecules of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

102
00:06:20,065 --> 00:06:23,091
to make one molecule of glucose
phosphate

103
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,144
thus the Calvin cycle has to run six
times to produce one molecule

104
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:29,133
of glucose

105
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:34,051
these molecules can remove their
phosphate and add fructose to form

106
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:34,138
sucrose

107
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,083
the molecule plants used to transport
carbohydrates throughout their system

108
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,101
glucose phosphate is also the starting
molecule

109
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:49,035
for the synthesis of starch and
cellulose

110
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:52,054
plants produce sugars to use as storage
molecules

111
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:56,062
and structural components for their own
benefit

112
00:06:56,062 --> 00:07:01,129
by utilizing the energy of the Sun along
with inputs of water and carbon dioxide

113
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,082
plants act as glucose factories

114
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:10,151
photosynthetic organisms are the primary
producers on glucose on the planet

115
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,020
they also produce oxygen gas as a
byproduct

116
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:18,861
and thus served as the foundation of life
providing food and oxygen

117
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,883
for the complex food webs on both land

118
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,975
and in the oceans
