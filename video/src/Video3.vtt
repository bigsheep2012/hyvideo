1
00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:06.000
In order for plants to grow they need
imports of carbon dioxide,water and energy.

2
00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:10.820
The chemical process by which plants use
these resources to manufacture glucose

3
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.899
the building blocks of plants, is called
photosynthesis.

4
00:00:15.517 --> 00:00:19.026
In the process oxygen gas is produced as a byproduct.

5
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:23.300
The energy for photosynthesis originates
in the sun

6
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.360
and arrives at the earth as sunlight.

7
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:30.038
This light has both a wave and a
particle nature.

8
00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:34.039
The particles or photons are the
smallest units of light.

9
00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:40.000
Photons oscillates along a path which is
measured as wavelengths.

10
00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:46.016
The light emitted from the sun contains
photons in a wide spectrum of wavelengths,

11
00:00:46.063 --> 00:00:49.130
called the electromagnetic spectrum.

12
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:58.000
Photosynthetic organisms use only a
small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light.

13
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:04.000
Photosynthetic organisms contain
pigments that facilitate the capture of wavelengths of light

14
00:01:04.028 --> 00:01:06.120
in the visible light range.

15
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:11.028
The color of a pigment comes from the
wavelengths of light reflected.

16
00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:16.049
Plants appear green because they reflect
yellow and green wavelengths of light.

17
00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:19.838
Red and blue wavelengths of light are
absorbed by these pigments,

18
00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:24.567
and provide the energy that is used for
photosynthesis

19
00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.000
Within eukaryotic photosynthetic
organisms, also known as photoautotrophs,

20
00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.466
the chemical reactions of photosynthesis
occur within plant cells

21
00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.068
in specialized structures known as
chloroplasts.

22
00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.000
Photosynthesis consists of two sets of
reactions -

23
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.021
the light dependent reactions and the
Calvin cycle.

24
00:01:46.084 --> 00:01:51.200
Within the chloroplast are small disc
like structures called thylakoids,

25
00:01:51.332 --> 00:01:55.760
which are surrounded by a fluid-filled space called the stroma.

26
00:01:56.033 --> 00:02:02.039
The reactions that synthesize glucose:
the Calvin cycle - occur in the stroma.

27
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.040
The light dependent reactions occur in
the thylakoid.

28
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.512
It is here that conversion of light
energy to chemical energy is initiated.

29
00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.848
In most photosynthetic organisms thylakoid
contain pairs of photosystems

30
00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.114
called photosystem I and photosystem II

31
00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:28.000
that work in tandem to produce the
energy that will later be used in the stroma to manufacture sugars.

32
00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.098
The photosystems of the thylakoid
consist of

33
00:02:31.098 --> 00:02:34.800
a network of accessory pigment molecules and
chlorophyll -

34
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.093
the molecules that absorb the photons of light.

35
00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:44.400
Within the pigment molecules, the absorbed
light energy excites electrons to a higher state.

36
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.500
Photosystems will channel the excitation energy
gathered by the pigment molecules to

37
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.000
a reaction center chlorophyll molecule,

38
00:02:53.015 --> 00:02:56.634
which will then pass the electrons to a
series of proteins

39
00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.940
located on the final thylakoid membrane.

40
00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:04.111
Photons of light strike photosystems
I & II simultaneously.

41
00:03:05.011 --> 00:03:10.560
We will examine what happens with the
photon striking photosystem II first.

42
00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:15.819
The energized electrons are passed from
the reaction center of photosystem II

43
00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.026
to an electron transport chain.

44
00:03:19.026 --> 00:03:22.065
The electrons lost by photosystem II

45
00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.304
are replaced by a process called
photolysis,

46
00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.374
which involves the oxidation of a water
molecule

47
00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.360
producing free electrons and oxygen gas.

48
00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:35.802
While this oxygen gas is a byproduct of
photosynthesis,

49
00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:43.002
it is an important input to the
cellular respiration pathways.

50
00:03:43.063 --> 00:03:46.804
As electrons passed through the electron
transport chain,

51
00:03:47.004 --> 00:03:51.802
the energy from the electron is used to
pump hydrogen ions from the stroma

52
00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:56.077
to the thylakoid, creating a
concentration gradient.

53
00:03:56.077 --> 00:04:00.815
This gradient powers a protein called
ATP synthases,

54
00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:05.100
which phosphorylate ADP to form ATP.

55
00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:09.024
The low-energy electrons leaving
photosystem II

56
00:04:09.024 --> 00:04:12.089
are shuttled to photosystem I.

57
00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:16.900
Within photosystem one I energy electrons
are reenergized

58
00:04:17.004 --> 00:04:20.078
and are passed through an electron
transport chain,

59
00:04:20.814 --> 00:04:29.092
where they are used to reduce the electron carrier NADP+ to NADPH.

60
00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:42.087
When the chloroplast is receiving a
steady supply of photons,

61
00:04:42.087 --> 00:04:45.020
NADPH and ATP molecules

62
00:04:46.028 --> 00:04:50.800
are rapidly being provided to the
metabolic pathways in the stroma

63
00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:56.083
Therefore the ATP and NADPH form during
the light dependent reactions

64
00:04:56.083 --> 00:05:00.161
are used in the stroma to fuel the
Calvin cycle reactions.

65
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:04.270
The Calvin cycle consists of a series of
reactions

66
00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:11.000
that reduce carbon dioxide to produce
the carbohydrate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

67
00:05:11.027 --> 00:05:16.149
The cycle consists of three steps: the
first of which is carbon fixation.

68
00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:22.053
In this step carbon dioxide is attached
to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate

69
00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:31.000
resulting in a six carbon molecule that
splits into two three carbon molecules.

70
00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.630


71
00:05:31.635 --> 00:05:44.844
The second step is a sequence of
reactions using electrons from NADPH and some of the ATP to reduce carbon dioxide.

72
00:05:45.064 --> 00:05:50.093
In the final step ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is regenerated.

73
00:05:51.064 --> 00:05:56.541
For every three turns of the cycle, five
molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

74
00:05:57.041 --> 00:06:04.041
are used to reform three molecules of
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate.

75
00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:15.036
The remaining glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is then used
to make glucose, fatty acids or glycerol.

76
00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.784
It takes two molecules of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

77
00:06:20.065 --> 00:06:23.091
to make one molecule of glucose
phosphate.

78
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:29.144
Thus, the Calvin cycle has to run six
times to produce one molecule of glucose.

79
00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:34.800
These molecules can remove their
phosphate and add fructose to form sucrose.

80
00:06:35.038 --> 00:06:40.083
The molecule plants used to transport
carbohydrates throughout their system.

81
00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:48.501
Glucose phosphate is also the starting
molecule for the synthesis of starch and
cellulose.

82
00:06:49.035 --> 00:06:55.854
Plants produce sugars to use as storage
molecules and structural components for their own
benefit.

83
00:06:56.062 --> 00:07:04.629
By utilizing the energy of the Sun, along
with inputs of water and carbon dioxide, plants act as glucose factories.

84
00:07:05.082 --> 00:07:10.151
Photosynthetic organisms are the primary
producers on glucose on the planet.

85
00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.000
They also produce oxygen gas as a
byproduct

86
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.861
and thus served as the foundation of life,
providing food and oxygen

87
00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:21.883
for the complex food webs on both land

88
00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.975
and in the oceans
